# JS
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning JavaScript from the ground up. It includes basic concepts, hands-on practice exercises, mini-projects, and notes as I explore the language. Whether you're a beginner like me or someone looking to revise the fundamentals, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
